# Getting started

To run the tests just run
> docker-compose up


# Credits

This repository and its contents are derived from the examples from https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-cpp/
This is meant as a simple example on how to start testing with cucumber-cpp.

# Limitations

Currently Cucumber-cpp is limited to running with cucumber 2.0, because somewhere there are some issues in the wiring-protocol.
